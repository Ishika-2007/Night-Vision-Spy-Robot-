# Night-Vision-Spy-Robot-
It is a Wi-Fi controlled surveillance robot built using NodeMCU and ESP32-CAM that features real-time live video streaming, dual ultrasonic sensors for front and rear obstacle detection, and a responsive web interface for manual control and speed adjustment. The system is designed for remote monitoring with enhanced mobility and obstacle awareness.

Features
-> Live Video Streaming with ESP32-CAM (supports night vision)
->  Wireless Control over Wi-Fi via web server
->  DC Motor Control (forward, backward, left, right, stop)
->  Dual Ultrasonic Sensors for front and back obstacle detection
-> Real-Time Distance Monitoring on web dashboard
->  Motor Speed Control via slider on UI
-> Auto-stop on obstacle detection (with manual override)

Technologies & Components Used
   Hardware:
-> NodeMCU ESP8266 – Hosts the web server and controls motors/sensors
-> ESP32-CAM – Streams video over Wi-Fi
-> DC Motors + L298N Driver – Motion system
-> Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) – Front and back obstacle detection
-> Rechargeable Battery Pack
-> IR/Night Vision LEDs (optional)

  Software:
-> Arduino IDE – Code development and uploading
-> Proteus – Circuit design and simulation
-> HTML + CSS + JS – Web interface
